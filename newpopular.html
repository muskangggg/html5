                            The epilogue is underway in My Hero Academia's manga, detailing what is to become of the
                            heroes now that the fight has ended against All For One and Shigaraki. While readers have
                            already gotten glimpses at the near future of many of the young heroes, the printed story is
                            also taking a look at some of the top pro heroes. While we've seen Endeavor trying to pick
                            up the piece of his life and the lives of his family, so to have we now seen what is in
                            store for the future of Hawks, the one time number two hero
                        </p>

                            Hawks was one of the biggest losers of the final battle even if he was able to escape the
                            fight against All For One with his life. Losing his Quirk thanks to the nefarious villain,
                            his days in the field seem over. Luckily, now that All for One, Shigaraki, and the other
                            villains have been taken off the board, Keigo Takami might not be needed when it comes to
                            fighting crime.

                        <h3>Hawks: President of The Hero Public Safety Commission</h3>
                        <p>Hawks is the newly elected President of the Hero Public Safety Commission, despite his young
                            age. Since he was a child, Takami has been working on behalf of the Commission so rising in
                            its ranks, especially following the wild events of the final battle, does make sense. Even
                            though Keigo might not be soaring through the air, he'll be front and center when it comes
                            to many of the heroes' affairs within Hero Society. </p>
